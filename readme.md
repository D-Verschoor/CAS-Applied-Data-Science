# Certificate of Advanced Studies (CAS) in Applied Data Science

With the explosion of data in science, economics, administration, medicine, and many other fields, the importance and demand for data science skills are increasing. Data science is a discipline consisting of applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, ethics, and subject-specific knowledge in various application areas. It involves scientific methods and processes to extract knowledge and insights from data.

The CAS in Applied Data Science is organized into six modules, spanning 21 course days from August to January, and targets professionals and researchers in both the private and public sectors. The curriculum covers the full data cycle: from data acquisition and planning, to visualization, inference, machine learning, best practices, ethics, and deep learning.

The teaching methods are modern and peer-oriented. Participants should have practical experience, a higher education degree, and a mathematical background. The program emphasizes the application of concepts and tools common in data science infrastructure and software, rather than theoretical elaboration on mathematics, statistics, and informatics.
